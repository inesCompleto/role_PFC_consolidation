# Role of PFC in the encoding of congruent events
We include here the Python notebooks that produce each of the figures in [Guerreiro and Clopath (2024)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403648121).

<code>Code_Figs.ipynb</code> contains the code that produces all main figures, and Supplementary Figures S2-S5, S7, S9 and S11

<code>Encoding_several_days.ipynb</code> contains the code that produces Supplementary Figure S1.

All reamining Supplementary Figures can be easily produces by slight changes in the main code (<code>Code_Figs.ipynb</code>), indicated in the respective notebook section.
